# Hey guys! So we are ready for Tambola!

All of you should join Zoom to play the game.

Open the [game portal](https://tambola.sidharth.dev/) to get your ticket. Each ticket will have a name and 15 numbers.

The Tambola masters will announce numbers between 1 and 90 on call and you can mark them on your tickets.

Once you get any of the 5 winning combinations below, you should yell **the name on your ticket** (and put it in zoom chat) to claim that prize. If the claim is valid, you will get the prize money. **Otherwise your ticket will be cancelled!**

In case there are conflicts, the first valid claim in the Moderator's **Zoom chat** window will be selected.

## Winning Combinations
